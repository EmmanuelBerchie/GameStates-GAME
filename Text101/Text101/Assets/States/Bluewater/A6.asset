  storyText: "Right, well, that took far longer than anticipated but the lock is
    off and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being so loud.
    \r\n\r\nYou're in a dark room. You hear people yelling over the top of the building.
    You catch some words. Bags dropping \"get the cash\", HURRY, HURRY \"...get out
    in time?\", GAS SPILLING \"...guards could get here any minute\", Bags dropping,
    GAS SPILLING \"Rich we'll be\"\r\n\r\nWhat next, Adventurer?\r\n\r\n1. Get closer
    to the people speaking.\r\n2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship."
