    filled with what looks to be cash, this could be mean they've broken into the
    bluewater safe the largest in the city. \r\n\r\nOne of the men begins to spread
    gasoline everywhere with a timer to set off a lighter to start a fire. They both
    run off as the timer begins \r\n\r\nWhat to do?\r\n\r\n1. Quick, remove the time
    lighter to prevent the fire \r\n2. Chase the men."
