  storyText: 'Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end
    up  in a  cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and patched together
    with plate metal and thick red wires.

    

    You have no idea where you
    are. And your head hurts.

    

    So, what to do now, slugger?

    

    1.
    Wait it out. My head hurts.

    2. Slam into the door with all my might.'
