Finally, I've reached the bluewater river. 
Thugs in groups of as many 10 to 15 there's too many to count . They've spotted you !!!!

Could i singlehandely take out these thugs surely they dont have the skills i possess.

What Should i do ? 
1. Take them on 
2. Turn back but that could set my arrival time up by at least an hour.
